# Functional Programming in Scala - by Example

## Purpose

### Functionally

1. Cover functional programming from principles
2. Document FP concepts in a semantically rich way
3. Demonstrate FP concepts through implementations from [a number of frameworks and other resources](#resources)
4. Cross reference between code and FP concepts in order to strengthen the understanding
5. Cross reference between code and FP concepts and resources for the same reason (longer term)

### Technically

1. Show that [Specs2] is indeed *the* net superior way to do [literate programming] in Scala when compared with [Scalatex], [Tut], [Dotlit], [Literator] and [Docco]
2. Advance some ideas about interlinking code and knowledge resources.

## Why?

Not trying to say more about functional programming in Scala but to increase the density of knowledge (per pixel, neuron, electron, click, etc) by

1. Aggregating and cross-referencing between code, concepts (in wiki, ontologies, topic maps) and [unstructured resources](#unstructured_resources)
2. Using literate programming and deliberate learning
